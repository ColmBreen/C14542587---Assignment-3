DT228/2 OOP - Assignment 3


First Deliverable (22/02/2016) : 

For my third assigment I plan to create a side scrolling platformer type game. 
I plan to create this game in Unity. For this project I will be working alone rather than in a group.




Final Deliverable (20/ 04/ 2016) :

For my third assignment I created a 2-D platform shooter in Unity 3-D.
When the program is initially run, the main menu will be displayed. From here the user can choose to 
either play the game or quit. If the player chooses to quit, a sub menu will pop up making sure that they
wish to quit. If the player chooses the play game button, the game will be loaded. From here, the player controls
a character which can move left and right, shoot in wither direction, jump and throw grenades. Enemies will begin
to spawn on wither side of the enemy. If they are within range, the enemies will shoot at the player. The players 
objective is to make it to the end of the level by killing the enemies who get in their way. Within the game, pickups
can be found which provide the player with a full health boost or faster speed of fire for their weapon. If the player dies
they level is reset with the player having to start again. The player has three lives. If they lose all of their lives a Game Over
message is shown and the user is taken back to the main menu. If the player manages to make it to the end of the level, a simial You 
Won message is displayed and the user is once again taken back to the main menu.
